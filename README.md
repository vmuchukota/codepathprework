My app idea is called Karades! This app would be a combination of charades and karoake. There would be two main ways of playing this game, as a group or individually. The app would play a song and the players would try to guess the song befroe the time runs out. The second way would be when one group/person acts out the song while its playing while the other side guesses the song. 

## Notes


Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I had trouble with getting the simulation to work because my laptop didn't have enough storage.
